	Abstract: - We study the stability of optical wave in Double Core Optical Fibre of Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation model.
     consider the Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation model with inclusion of Cross Phase Modulation. Linear stability analysisâ€™s is 
     applied to Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation and obtained modulation instability criterion, using modulation instability criterion,
     we analysed the role of Cross Phase Modulation on stability of optical wave in Double Core Optical Fibre.
		
This paper was successfully completed and the stability criterion was obtained. The current status of our
 research paper is under review by our guide Dr. E Parasuraman.
